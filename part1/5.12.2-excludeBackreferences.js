/* Task:

In simple cases of circular references, we can exclude an offending property from serialization by its name.

But sometimes we canâ€™t just use the name, as it may be used both in circular references and normal properties. So we can check the property by its value.

Write replacer function to stringify everything, but remove properties that reference meetup:

result should be:
{
  "title":"Conference",
  "occupiedBy":[{"name":"John"},{"name":"Alice"}],
  "place":{"number":23}
}
*/

let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  occupiedBy: [{name: "John"}, {name: "Alice"}],
  place: room
};

// circular references
room.occupiedBy = meetup;
meetup.self = meetup;

let solution = JSON.stringify(meetup, function replacer(key, value) {
  if (key != '' && value == meetup) return undefined;
  return value;
});

console.log(solution);
